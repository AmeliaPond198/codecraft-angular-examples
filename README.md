# Codecraft-tv Angular Examples

This repository contains the examle samples of tutorials from [codecraft.tv](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/) on Angular framework. Difference between this & its original example repo is, here All the example projects were generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4 while in original repo one file code structure is followed. So, through these examples it's bit easy to play with examples, add new component or service, then use similar logic in real world application.

## Live Preview
Live preview of these examples is possible with stackblitz.com. For running any particular example, respective stackblitz url can be:

  `https://stackblitz.com/github/{repository}/{sub/folder/paths}`

  e.g.
  
  https://stackblitz.com/github/shant24k/codecraft-angular-examples/tree/master/ROUTING/Route-Configuration
  
## Run locally

Alternative to above approach all the examples can be executed locally (on localhost). For that you've to clone this repository. Then, go to directory of any example & first run `npm install` to install all the dependencies & then use `ng serve` for a dev server (as all the examples are created with Angular cli). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
